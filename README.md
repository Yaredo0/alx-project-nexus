Here’s a strong Markdown‑formatted README you can submit for your Project Nexus – ProDev Frontend Engineering Movie App:
# Project Nexus – ProDev Frontend Engineering 🎬

## Overview
Project Nexus is my capstone project for the **ALX ProDev Frontend Engineering program**.  
I chose to build a **Movie App** that demonstrates modern frontend practices: responsive design, API integration, and a clean, user‑friendly interface.  

The app showcases trending movies, top‑rated content, featured shows, playlists, and genre filtering — all powered by external APIs and structured with reusable components.

---

## Project Description
The Movie App is designed as a **streaming‑style platform** where users can:
- Browse trending and top‑rated movies.
- View featured shows in a carousel.
- Save items to a personal playlist (persisted via local storage).
- Filter movies by genre.
- Navigate seamlessly across sections with a sidebar and responsive layout.

This project reflects the **frontend engineering journey**: from component‑driven development to API consumption, styling consistency, and deployment troubleshooting.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js / React** – core framework for building the app  
- **TypeScript** – type safety and maintainability  
- **TMDB API** – external movie data integration  
- **Styled Components / TailwindCSS** – styling and theme consistency  
- **React Hooks & Context API** – state management  
- **LocalStorage** – lightweight persistence for playlists  

---

## Key Features
- 🎬 **Featured Carousel** – auto‑rotating backdrop images with navigation arrows and dots  
- ⭐ **Trending & Top Rated Sections** – dynamic grids of movie cards  
- 📂 **Playlists** – add/remove favorites, stored locally  
- 🎭 **Genre Filter** – filter movies by category  
- 📱 **Responsive Layout** – sidebars and content adapt to screen sizes  

---

## Challenges & Solutions
- **API Integration Errors**  
  *Solution:* Centralized API helpers, fallback handling, and environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`).  

- **Styling Consistency Across Devices**  
  *Solution:* Adopted theme‑driven colors and reusable style tokens.  

- **Deployment Glitches**  
  *Solution:* Debugged environment variables and added fallback UI/error handling.  

---

## Best Practices & Takeaways
- Modular, reusable components  
- Environment variables for sensitive configs  
- Clear repo structure aligned with checkers  
- Documented workflows for reproducibility  
- Clean commits and descriptive README for maintainability  

---

## Collaboration
Although this is a **frontend‑focused project**, collaboration with backend learners was essential to understand API design and data modeling. This ensured smooth integration with TMDB endpoints and prepared me for full‑stack workflows.

This version is ready to paste into your repo. It’s clear, professional, and highlights your frontend focus while showing collaboration and problem‑solving.
👉 Do you want me to also add a “Getting Started” section (installation, setup, run instructions) so reviewers can clone and run your app easily? That would make your submission even stronger.
