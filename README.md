# ALX Project Nexus

## Overview
Project Nexus is a documentation hub capturing my major learnings from the **ProDev Frontend Engineering program**. It also highlights collaboration with backend learners, reflecting the full-stack perspective.

---

## Program Overview
The **ProDev Backend Engineering program** complements frontend development by providing robust APIs, database management, and scalable server-side solutions. Collaboration between frontend and backend learners ensures complete, production-ready applications.

---

## Major Learnings

### Key Technologies
- **Mobile Development** (React Native, Expo)
- **Web Development** (Next.js, React)
- **Progressive Web Apps (PWA)**
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **GraphQL** for efficient data queries
- **API Integration** with REST and GraphQL endpoints
- **TailwindCSS / NativeWind** for styling
- **System Design and Analysis** for scalable architecture

### Important Frontend Concepts
- Component-driven development with React/Next.js
- Routing and navigation patterns
- State management (React hooks, Context API)
- Responsive and accessible design
- Documentation and reproducible workflows

---

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge:** Debugging API integration errors.  
  **Solution:** Used environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`) and centralized API helpers.
- **Challenge:** Styling consistency across devices.  
  **Solution:** Adopted TailwindCSS/NativeWind with reusable style configs.
- **Challenge:** Repo structure compliance for checkers.  
  **Solution:** Verified file/folder layouts before submission.

---

## Best Practices & Personal Takeaways
- Always use environment variables for sensitive configs.
- Keep code modular and reusable.
- Document workflows for reproducibility.
- Collaborate actively with backend learners to align endpoints and data models.
- Value clean commits and clear README files for maintainability.

---

## Collaboration
- **Frontend Learners:** Exchange ideas, organize study/coding sessions.  
- **Backend Learners:** Essential collaboration to consume their endpoints.  
- **Where:** Dedicated Discord channel `#ProDevProjectNexus`.
